## Agenda

### Updates

- Discussed that we will prepare a major release, v1.0.
  First step is to gather proposals for items that would be breaking changes.
  We are assigning them to the "Next Major" milestone, and organizing them in the roadmap
  project board: https://github.com/orgs/typeorm/projects/1/views/3
- Based on open & close-to-merge PRs we should be able to do another solid patch release in the next few weeks.
- Naor was not able to attend so no updates on the website yet.

## Action Items

- Members will take some time to add issues to the next major milestone, and in the next meeting we can
  discuss.
